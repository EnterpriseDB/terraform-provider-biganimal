## Example of Creating a Single Node Cluster and Its Faraway Replica

BigAnimal does not currently support provisioning a replica on a different cloud provider from the source cluster.
That's why both the cluster and the faraway replica in this example are running on the same cloud provider.

## Example of promoting a Faraway Replica

To promote a Faraway Replica you have to change the resource "biganimal_faraway_replica" to "biganimal_faraway_replica_promoted_cluster"
in your terraform file, use the same fields and the moved command as shown in the example below. You can overwrite your terraform file 
with the example file, but make sure the moved commands corresponds to your previous resource and name.

e.g.
moved {
  from = biganimal_faraway_replica.faraway_replica                    // your previous resource and name
  to   = biganimal_faraway_replica_promoted_cluster.promoted_cluster  // migrate to this resource and name
}
