# biganimal_region (Resource)

The region resource is used to manage regions for a given cloud provider. See [Activating regions](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions/) for more details.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    biganimal = {
      source  = "EnterpriseDB/biganimal"
      version = "0.5.1"
    }
  }
}

variable "project_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "BigAnimal Project ID"
}

resource "biganimal_region" "this" {
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region_id      = "eu-west-1"
  project_id     = var.project_id
}

output "region_status" {
  value = resource.biganimal_region.this.status
}

output "region_name" {
  value = resource.biganimal_region.this.name
}

output "region_continent" {
  value = resource.biganimal_region.this.continent
}
```

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
