# biganimal_tag (Resource)

Tags will enable users to categorize and organize resources across types and improve the efficiency of resource retrieval

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    biganimal = {
      source  = "EnterpriseDB/biganimal"
      version = "1.2.1"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "3.6.0"
    }
  }
}

resource "biganimal_tag" "tag" {
  tag_name = "tag-name"
  // The default colors to choose from are:
  // magenta, red, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, indigo, purple and grey
  // you can also use a custom hex color code e.g. #e34545
  color = "blue"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `tag_name` (String)

### Optional

- `color` (String)
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `tag_id` (String)

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
