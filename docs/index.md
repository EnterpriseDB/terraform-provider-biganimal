# BigAnimal Provider

A Terraform Provider to manage your workloads on [EDB BigAnimal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/biganimal-cloud-postgresql)
by interacting with the BigAnimal API. The provider is licensed under the [MPL v2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available provider resources and data sources.

## Requirements

* A BigAnimal account with an organization set up. If you don't already have a BigAnimal account,
see [Getting started with the BigAnimal free trial.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/latest/free_trial/)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 0.13.x or later.
* A BigAnimal API token (https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/latest/reference/api/#using-the-get-token-script)

## Example Usage
```terraform
# Configure the BigAnimal Provider
provider "biganimal" {
  ba_bearer_token = "<redacted>"
  // ba_access_key: if set, this will be used instead of the ba_bearer_token above.
  // This can also be set as an environment variable. If it is set both here and
  // in an environment variable then the access key set in the environment variable
  // will take priority and be used
  ba_access_key = "<redacted>"
  //ba_api_uri   = "https://portal.biganimal.com/api/v3" // Optional
}
# Manage the resources
```
