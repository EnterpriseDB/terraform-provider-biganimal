# Terraform Provider Biganimal PoC (Terraform Plugin SDK)

This repository is manually created from the [Terraform Plugin Scaffolding](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding) repository.
It's in experimental phase, and intends to be the playground for the Biganimal Terraform Provider.

Biganimal Resource and Datasource definitions are under (`biganimal/provider`)

For now, we're using the terraform modules within `examples/` for development purposes. You can run `terraform plan` in any of these modules.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.13.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.18

## Building

Builds are done via make targets.  Running `make` will build and install the provider binary into `~/.terraform.d/plugins/...`

```bash
$ make
go build -o terraform-provider-biganimal
mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/hashicorp.com/edu/biganimal/0.3.1/darwin_amd64
mv terraform-provider-biganimal ~/.terraform.d/plugins/hashicorp.com/edu/biganimal/0.3.1/darwin_amd64
```

The binary can also be compiled by `go build`, which will output the binary into the current directory.

## Using the provider

Until the provider is accepted into the terraform registry, it's necesary to install the binary into your local terraform cache using `make`, and to configure terraform to look in the right location to find the binary.

Terraform can be configured by adding the following to your ~/.terraformrc file.

```hcl
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
      "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/biganimal" = "/Users/YOUR_HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/hashicorp.com/edu/biganimal/0.3.1/darwin_amd64"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

### Getting an API Token

in order to access the Biganimal API, it's necessary to fetch an api bearer token and export it into your environment.

This can be done by using the script located [here](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/blob/main/api/get-token.sh) as follows

```bash
sh ~/hackery/edb/cloud-utilities/api/get-token.sh
Please login to https://auth.biganimal.com/activate?user_code=JWPL-RCXL with your BigAnimal account
Have you finished the login successfully? (y/N) y
{
  "access_token": "<REDACTED>",
  "refresh_token": "<REDACTED>",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Once the token has been retrieved, set it in your environment as follows

```bash
export BA_BEARER_TOKEN=<REDACTED>
```

After compiling, configuring the `.terraformrc` and fetching a token, the examples in the `./examples` folder can be run.

## Debugging the provider

If you're using Vscode, you can use the embedded Golang Debugger. Intro to debugging in Vscode is [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

There is already a .vscode/launch.json file, so you can easily run `Debug - Attach External CLI` in the Run and Debug section, which is going to print a `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` env var if your code builds successfully. The env var looks similar to this one:

```bash
$> TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/biganimal":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":14123,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/99/kt3b7rgn7wbcc55jt9zv_rch0000gn/T/plugin608643082"}}}'
```

You can navigate to `examples/provider` directory and run your terraform commands with this env var:

```bash
$> TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/biganimal":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":14123,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/99/kt3b7rgn7wbcc55jt9zv_rch0000gn/T/plugin608643082"}}}' terraform plan
```

## Next steps, what can you do?

- [biganimal/provider/data_source_cluster.go](./biganimal/provider/data_source_cluster.go) is a good starting point. You can investigate the contents of the Json response and how it's [unmarshalled to clusters struct](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/terraform-provider-biganimal/blob/b96336c0cb06d481854cdf0db0688de694e02a71/biganimal/provider/data_source_cluster.go#L103).
  - Add/remove new fields, experiment with how to consume those values, like using them in the resource, or printing their value in the outputs.
- _**[[API client]]**_ You can set up an apiClient inside [biganimal/provider/provider.go](./biganimal/provider/provider.go) and configure it, so that this client can be used in data sources and resources. There are code crumbs in that provider.go file, they don't work for now ðŸ˜…
- You can start experimenting with [biganimal/provider/resource_cluster.go](biganimal/provider/resource_cluster.go). It has the blueprints for the CRUD operations. Feel free to start writing them.
- While experimenting with the API calls, feel free to propose any schema designs. That would be very helpful for the RFC.
- _**[[API client]]**_ [biganimal/openapi directory](./biganimal/openapi/)  is a direct copy of [the generated API Golang SDK v2 from the upm-cli repository](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/upm-cli/tree/yh-8468-sdk-v2/generated/apiv2) (See [this PR](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/upm-cli/pull/242) for details.) This is a temporary situation, It's not decided yet where to reside this library.
- Tests generate is failing after each commit in Github(See [the GH Actions](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/terraform-provider-biganimal/actions)). If you can fix/silence it, that would be nice ðŸ˜Š
